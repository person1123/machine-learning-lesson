            <p>Every prediction of the future has artificial intelligence. But although computers have beaten humans at chess, Go,  and more, we still claim that artificial intelligence is something that does not yet exist. Instead, what we have is "machine learning."</p>
            <p>Computers are tools for following rules very quickly. Typically, humans create these rules. Machine learning is where the computers figure out the rules for themselves.
            To see how this works, you will first teach a computer how to sort these colored balls, based on the brightness picked up by a camera and the size of the ball. Try to select all the small, green balls.</p>

            <p>This is doable. But real world tasks are far more difficult. Let's say you're a bank, and you want to find out which mortgages to approve. Can you teach the computer how to figure out which ones to approve based on statistics about the applicant, such as their income and the income of their neighborhood?</p>
