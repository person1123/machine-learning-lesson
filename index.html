            <p>Every prediction of the future has artificial intelligence. But although computers have beaten humans at chess, Go,  and more, we still claim that artificial intelligence is something that does not yet exist. Instead, what we have is "machine learning."</p>
            <p>Computers are tools for following rules very quickly. Typically, humans create these rules. Machine learning is where the computers figure out the rules for themselves.
            To see how this works, you will first teach a computer how to sort these colored balls, based on the brightness picked up by a camera and the size of the ball. Try to select all the small, green balls.</p>

        <div class="text-box box" id="real-world-text">
            <p>This is doable. But real world tasks are far more difficult. Let's say you're a bank, and you want to find out which mortgages to approve. Can you teach the computer how to figure out which ones to approve based on statistics about the applicant, such as their income and the income of their neighborhood?</p>

            <p> That was a little too hard, right? Although we know these are all factors, we don’t fully understand how they combine. But computers are very good at doing things fast. This is where machine learning comes in. If we show the computer hundreds of examples, we can adjust the knobs every time it gets one wrong, based on how much that knob contributed to that mistake. This will automatically correct for errors over and over until the predictions are extremely good.</p>

        <div class="text-box box" id="what-taught-text">
            <p> But what exactly did the computer teach itself? Since we didn’t tell it what to do, in order to understand why it does any particular action we have to guess based on what it does to similar inputs. For example, let’s take a look at the houses two different neighborhoods with the same median input.</p>
